        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Check out some of the examples on how to use amenti.  You know, spark some ideas.</p>

        <h3><a href="room/index.html">Room</a></h3>
        <p>
          A basic room page with a header, main, and footer.  Here we bring in an amenti room
          and render a template into a dom selector, and then open the rooms.
        </p>
        
        <h3><a href="hall_room/index.html">Hall &amp; Room</a></h3>
        <p>
          In this example we use a Hall &amp; Room to create a bit more structure to our code,
          and also demonstrate how a hall can open many rooms.
        </p>
        
        <h3><a href="guide_hall_room/index.html">Guide, Hall &amp; Room</a></h3>
        <p>
          This example demonstrates how to use a Guide, Hall, and Room together.
          The Guide will be used for routing/api requests to a server.  Halls for
          holding many rooms.  Rooms to provide the application funcdtionality.
